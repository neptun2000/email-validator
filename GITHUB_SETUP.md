# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps in a new session to push the email validator project to GitHub:

1. First, create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: email-validator
   - Make it Public
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):
   - Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Note: "Email Validator Repository Access"
   - Select scopes: 
     - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)

3. In your new Replit session, run these commands:
```bash
# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Email validation API with documentation"

# Add remote repository (replace YOUR_PAT with your personal access token)
git remote add origin https://YOUR_PAT@github.com/neptun2000/email-validator.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

4. Verify the repository:
   - Go to https://github.com/neptun2000/email-validator
   - You should see all your files including:
     - README.md
     - API_EXAMPLES.md
     - All source code files

Note: Keep your personal access token secure and don't share it with anyone. You can always generate a new one if needed.
